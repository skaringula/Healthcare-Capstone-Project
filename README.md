# Healthcare Capstone Project

## Problem Statement:
- NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.
- The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
- Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.

I completed this project for my capstone which was the final assessment for the Data Science Master's Program from Simplilearn. The objective of this project was to analyze the datasets from NIDKK to draw valauble insights from the medical predictor variables (glucose, insulin, blood pressure, etc.) and see how those impact the target variable (outcome - whether the patient is diagnosed with diabetes or not). After preliminary cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis of the dataset, I moved on to train multiple classification algorithms for the prediction of diabetes in patients. I compared the performance of these models to find that the Random Forest machine learning model produced the best performance for this project. Lastly, I created a dashboard for the visualization the relationship between the parameters and the outcome in the data which can be found here. 

### Tasks performed in this project: 
- Data Cleaning
- Data Transformation
- Data Modeling - various classification model
- Data Modeling - performance evaluation using various metrics
- Data Reporting - dashboarding in tableau

### Tools Used: 
- Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, Tableau
- ML Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM (Support Vector Machine) , Naive Bayes, KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors )
